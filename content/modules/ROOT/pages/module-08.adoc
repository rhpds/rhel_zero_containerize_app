Next you will pull down our application content from github and position
it within the container image.

First, clone the application content from github. For our example, we
are using a javascript based web application.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird
----

Cloning into '`clumsy-bird`'â€¦ remote: Enumerating objects: 1385, done.
remote: Total 1385 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1385
Receiving objects: 100% (1385/1385), 4.38 MiB | 8.88 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (693/693), done.

....

From the above output, you can see that the clone has been successful and in the current directory, you should now see a directory called `clumsy-bird` that contains the javascript based application.

Now, you will position this software within the container image you are building.

```bash
buildah copy ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird /var/www/html
....

63420a965b06ceaa3d61df013d51e0111d991f8b811c2df0164b649035543af3

....

At this point, all the software needed for the container is in the image contents.  You can commit hte working container to a new container image called `clumsy-bird`.

```bash
buildah commit ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird
....
