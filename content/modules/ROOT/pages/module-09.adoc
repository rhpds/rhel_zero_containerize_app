In the previous step, you committed your container image. You can look
at the images in the local container respository by using
`+podman image list+`.

[source,bash]
----
podman image list

Now that the image is available, you can run the container.  Because this application is managed by a service, you will use the `-d` option to run the container in a detatched mode.  Additionally, you will map content coming to port 8080 on the host system to be routed to the application running on the container's port 80.

```bash
podman run -d -p 8080:80 clumsy-bird
....

You can now access the running `+clumsy-bird+` application by connecting
to the systemâ€™s port 8080. The lab environment has this available to you
under the *Containerized Web App* tab.
