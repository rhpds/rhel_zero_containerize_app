At this point, the container is configured. It is time to transition
from a working container into a committed image. In the command below,
you will use the `+buildah+` command to commit the working container to
an image called: `+moon-buggy+`.

[source,bash]

The above output shows that the commit was successful, however you can verify
this by looking at the available container images on the system.

```bash
podman image list
....
