Now that the yum repositories are defined within the container, you can
use another `+dnf install+`, executed within the container, to install
the target software: `+moon-buggy+`.

[source,bash]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container -- dnf -y install moon-buggy
----

<<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED>>>

Complete! ```

From the above output, you can see that `+moon-buggy+` was successfully
installed into the container. The `+dnf+` transaction also installed
several required pieces of software as well.
