title: Build container images with Red Hat Enterprise Linux container tools
teaser: Add an existing application to a Red Hat universal base image container and
  deploy it.
description: |+
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to install additional
  software into a container image.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Downloading a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)
  * Positioning or configuring a container to use 3rd party repositories
  * Install 3rd party software into the container image
  * Commit changes to create a new container image
  * Validate the containerized application

  # Example Usecase:
  You have a piece of software that you would like to deploy within a container
  image rather than installing it natively on the host system.  By using a
  container image, you can copy the entire environment for the software to
  several different hosts or run multiple copies of it on the same system.
